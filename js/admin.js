The cushion-y ones feel like they are giving your feet a little massage.  The regular no-shows truly do not slide down my foot like every other sock has done before to the point where I stopped wearing socks.  I was amazed, especially since my right foot can't seem to keep a sock on do to an over-corrected hammer toe surgery that left my big and second toes in a permanent peace sign.  They stay on better than even other socks that have had the little silicone on the back that was supposed to keep them on.  Even while walking along our tile floors with just the socks on they stay on.  That, to me, is amazing.  My feet felt dry at the end of the day and I didn't get the swelling I usually do.  I think the only downside is that the no-shows do show when wearing my loafers, but I can definitely now wear socks with my sneakers and Crocs with no problems.  I have to admit, I was beside myself for spending so much on socks of all things, but I am now a believer.  Now if you would just get the blue grippers in stock, I'll be a happy camper.
